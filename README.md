# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers.

## Table of Contents
## Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that contains information about the passengers on the Titanic. This notebook aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using various features available in the dataset.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
